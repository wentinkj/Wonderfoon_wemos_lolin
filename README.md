# Wonderfoon

software version 0.0.1

A Wonderfoon is a rotary dial (or tdk) phone that is converted into a jukebox.
The Wonderfoon is build for people with dementia or Alzheimer disease.
The longterm memory with persons with dementia is most of the time still present. Therefore they still remember the rotary dial telephone from years ago. When the dial a number a song is played, the can be songs they like or songs from years ago, again in most situations song they still remember.

This combination of the old phone and the old music does create miracles.

Currently one known bug: for rotary disc phones quite frequently an extra pulse is counted on the start of the dial. Will fix within the next few days.
